Design Decisions

Interactive Elements:
 -Gradient animations on buttons and backgrounds provide visual feedback. Smooth transitions (0.3s ease) for hover states and transforms avoid jarring changes.

Responsive Layout:
 -Cards use auto-fill minmax(280px, 1fr) for fluid grid that adapts to any screen. Mobile view triggers at 768px with optimized spacing and stacked elements.

Search Experience:
 -Debounced input with suggestions dropdown. Results fade in as user types. Filters for region/language update grid instantly.

Modern Styling:
 -Dark theme with gradients and shadows creates depth. Text uses background-clip for gradient effects. Backdrop filters add glass morphism without impacting performance.

Automated Testing:

Use a testing framework like Jest or Mocha to validate:
Search functionality.
API responses (e.g., successful fetch, error handling).
Favorites management, including edge cases like exceeding the 5-country limit.

Responsiveness Testing:

Check the application on various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop) and screen resolutions.
Cross-Browser Testing:

Verify compatibility with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
Known Issues
