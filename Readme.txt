 Setup Instructions
1. Choosing a Programming Language:

    - This project primarily uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its functionality and design.
 
2. Installing an IDE (Integrated Development Environment):

    - Download and set up a code editor like Visual Studio Code or Sublime Text, which provides features like syntax highlighting and debugging tools.


 Design Decisions and Animations

1. Local Storage for Favorites:
   - Favorites are stored in localStorage to ensure data persists across sessions without requiring a backend.

2. Debounced Search:
   - Implemented debounce functionality to optimize search performance and reduce unnecessary API calls.

3. API Integration:
   - Used [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to fetch country data.

4. Accessibility:
   - All interactive elements (buttons, links) are accessible via keyboard navigation.

5. Responsive Layouts:
   - Designed with CSS Grid and Flexbox to adapt seamlessly across devices, from mobile to desktop screens.

6. Animations for User Engagement:
   - Smooth transitions for hover effects on buttons, links, and cards, providing a polished and interactive feel.
   - Implemented keyframe animations, such as:
     - **Gradient Background Animation: Background gradients on the search bar and buttons dynamically shift colors for a modern, lively appearance.
     - **Fade-In Effects: Elements like the country grid and details fade in smoothly to enhance the user experience.
     - **Pulse Animation: The "Show More" button uses a subtle pulsing effect to guide user attention.
   - Hover animations on country cards and buttons add depth and interactivity by scaling or shadowing elements slightly.
