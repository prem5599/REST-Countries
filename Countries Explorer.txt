 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the Repository:

  
  git clone https://github.com/prem5599/REST-Countries
 
  

2. Open the Application:

   - Use any live server extension (e.g., Live Server for VS Code) to serve the project.
   - Alternatively, open `index.html` directly in your browser.

3. Access Country Details:

   - Click on a country from the grid view to navigate to its details page.


 Design Decisions and Animations

1. Local Storage for Favorites:
   - Favorites are stored in localStorage to ensure data persists across sessions without requiring a backend.

2. Debounced Search:
   - Implemented debounce functionality to optimize search performance and reduce unnecessary API calls.

3. API Integration:
   - Used [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to fetch country data.

4. Accessibility:
   - All interactive elements (buttons, links) are accessible via keyboard navigation.

5. Responsive Layouts:
   - Designed with CSS Grid and Flexbox to adapt seamlessly across devices, from mobile to desktop screens.

6. Animations for User Engagement:
   - Smooth transitions for hover effects on buttons, links, and cards, providing a polished and interactive feel.
   - Implemented keyframe animations, such as:
     - **Gradient Background Animation: Background gradients on the search bar and buttons dynamically shift colors for a modern, lively appearance.
     - **Fade-In Effects: Elements like the country grid and details fade in smoothly to enhance the user experience.
     - **Pulse Animation: The "Show More" button uses a subtle pulsing effect to guide user attention.
   - Hover animations on country cards and buttons add depth and interactivity by scaling or shadowing elements slightly.

 Quality and Testing Expectations

1. Unit Testing:
   - Write unit tests to validate key functionalities of the application, focusing on critical components such as:
     - Search bar behavior.
     - API interactions (e.g., successful and failed requests).
     - Dynamic updates to the country grid and details view.

2. Testing Framework:

     - Handling failed API responses, such as 404 or 500 errors.
     - Empty or invalid search queries.
     - Filtering by unsupported or non-existent regions/languages.
     - Adding and removing countries from favorites, including edge cases like exceeding the limit of 5 favorites.

4. Edge Cases:
   - Test for unusual scenarios, including:
     - Countries with incomplete data (e.g., missing capital, languages, or population).
     - Network latency causing delayed API responses.
     - Clearing local storage and reloading the application.

5. Running Tests:
 

6. Continuous Improvement:
   - Regularly update tests as new features are added or existing features are modified.


Known Issues

1. API Rate Limits:

   - The REST Countries API may impose rate limits. In case of issues, wait and retry.

2. Edge Cases:

   - Some countries may have incomplete data (e.g., missing capital or languages).



Future Improvements

1. Add backend support for user accounts and server-side storage of favorites.
2. Improve error handling with user-friendly messages.
3. Implement additional filters (e.g., by currency or subregion).
4. Enhance the UI with more animations and transitions, such as:
   - Animated transitions when switching between pages.
   - Interactive feedback for user actions, such as saving favorites or applying filters.
